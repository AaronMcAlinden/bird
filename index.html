	<h2>In New Zealand's <br> Rugged Fiordland</h2>

	<p class="top_p">	
	A bird thought extinct for fifty years is struggling for survival. Behind the rare species in its fight for life is all the protective power of the Dominion Government.
	</p>
	<p>
	Rediscovery of this flightless bird, the large, brilliant&#45;hued native rail which the Maoris called takahea, meaning &ldquo;wandering at large,&rdquo; excited almost as much interest in New Zealand as discovery of a living passenger pigeon would arouse in America.
</p>
	<p>
To zoologists and bird lovers throughout the world, reappearance of takahea, now called the takahe, was a notable event. They had a scientific name for the creature&#45;Notornis hochstetteri, the first half of which means &ldquo;bird of the south&rdquo; &#45;but they knew tantalizingly little about it and had considered it lost in the limbo of vanished species.
</p>
		
	<p class="bottom_p">
To the rediscoverer, Dr. G. B. Orbell, a physician of Invercargill, New Zealand, the dramatic sight of a takahe alive came as the reward of years of patient and systematic search. Only four of the birds were known to science when he made his discovery on the shore of a lake in what is now called Notornis Valley. Since August, 1898, there had been no authentic report of one being caught, or even seen.

		Futile Wings Have <br>Three Foot Span

A primitive type of large moor hen found only in New Zealand, the takahe is unlike any other member of the world&#45;wide rail family to which it belongs. For example, despite its membership in an aquatic family, it avoids swamps and rivers. It does, however, share some of the clan 's characteristics, such as a large frontal shield.
</p>
<p>
The full grown takahe stands some twenty inches high and weighs about six pounds. The wings, though incapable of flight, may have a three foot span.
</p>
<p>
The adult bird is vividly colored. Head, neck, breast, and flanks are an iridescent indigo blue, becoming brighter on the shoulders and changing to a malachite green on the mantle. The dark rump and upper tail coverts are olive green, the abdomen and thighs purplish black, and the under tail coverts white. The powerful beak is scarlet at the base, fading outwards to a wax pink. Legs and feet are red, eyes reddish brown.
</p>
<p>
This brilliant color scheme is seen to full advantage only when the bird is approaching the observer or passing at right angles to him.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to its showy parents, the young takahe wears only a uniform, soft black down. The black beak is white tipped, and the disproportionately large legs are a pale purple.
</p>
<p class="bottom_p">
In New Zealand&rsquo;s ornithological history, extinction, or near extinction, has been the lot of many species as a result of settlement.
